# SQL - Python Project
I have decided to work on side projects to improve my Data Analyst/Engineer/ML skills and to create a portfolio for myself as I learn.
This is my first project. My projects will be inspired from youtube videos I come across. I will endeavour to share the link to those youtube videos
so as to credit the creators. The inspiration for this project is from "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ29DXaJ1Ts&t=707s" - techTFQ.
